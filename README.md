A Tool for Visualization the Evolution of the Test Smells

TSVizzEvolution a tool for visualizing the test smells and their evolution on software projects. 
It implements two visualization techniques: (i)Graph View, draws the associations between the test smells and the software artifacts (e.g., projectand test classes) and authors; and (ii)Timeline View, presents the test smells evolution over time.TSVizzEvolution integrates a conceptual framework under development by an inter-institutional researchersâ€™ team, which consists of test smells prevention, identification, refactoring, and visualization to improve the test codequality. 

To run the TSVizzEvolution tool, simply download the available jar: TSVizzEvolution.jar
