# TSVizzEvolution
A Tool for Visualization the Evolution of the Test Smells

TSVizzEvolution a tool for visualizing the test smells and their evolution on software projects. 
It implements two visualization techniques: (i)Graph View, draws the associations between the test smells and the software artifacts (e.g., projectand test classes) and authors; and (ii)Timeline View, presents the test smells evolution over time.
TSVizzEvolution integrates a conceptual framework under development by an inter-institutional researchers’ team, which consists of test smells prevention, identification, refactoring, and visualization to improve the test codequality. 

To run the TSVizzEvolution tool, simply download the available jar: TSVizzEvolution.jar

TSVizzEvolution has two types of analysis (Single Analysis and Evolution Analysis):
  #Single Analysis. 
  The Graph View is the visualization technique applied to single analysis. Therefore, we select version of the software
project and all types of granularity analysis. TSVizzEvolution supports views with different granularity: Project, All Test Classes, A Specific Test Class, A Specific Test Smells e Author. 
  - Project. The Blue Project icon represents the project, and the Gray Rectangle icon represents the test smells found in this version. This view allows
the user to quickly get a general idea of the project’s existing test smells. 
  - All Test Classes. This view represents an overview of all classes and test smells. The Blue Circle icon represents the test classes, and the Gray Rectangle icon represents the test smells found in those test classes.
  - A Specific Test Class. linked to five types of test smells, which corresponds to the Specific Test Class option. This view allows the user to choose a specific test class to analyze in detail.
  - A Specific Test Smell. 
  - Author. It presents one author linked to type of test smell, and this test smell linked to test classes. Indicates that this person is the author or assumes the authorship by guilt10 of that test smell. All authors option linked to only test smell. Most of them probably did not insert the test
smell; some inserted it, other assumed authorship by guilty.
